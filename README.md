changes mad today:
>removed the feature to enable and disable menu on both the sign up and log in page
    ..problem is that when i navigate from the signup page to the log in the menu is disabled<good but not the aim>
    ..observation; what ionic does is that since the folder file which had the menu stuff has been desabled, by pulling on  the side the 
        this creates an automatic back to previous page feature by sliding.

>deleted the home page
